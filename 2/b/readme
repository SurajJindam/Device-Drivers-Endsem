Question:
(b)Write a module which prints your name in log.

Logic:

1. Required header file is included  #include<linux/module.h>
2. Declaring a global char* variable myname to store name
3. Inside the init_module function the printk command is written printing the name
4. module_param(name,type,permission) -> module_param(myname,string,0) is used to take a string parameter when insmod is loaded.
5. make is executed
6. insmod name_param.ko myname="Suraj"  is given
7. To watch the print from log -> dmesg|tail -1  is compiled.

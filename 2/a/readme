Question:
(a) Write a module that can take an integer parameter when it is loaded with insmod command.

Logic:

1. Required header file is included  #include<linux/module.h>
2. Declaring a global integer variable count
3. Inside the init_module function the printk command is written printing the value of the count
4. module_param(name,type,permission) is used to take an integer parameter when insmod is loaded.
5. make is executed
6. insmod intger_param.ko count=21  is given
7. To watch the print from log -> dmesg|tail -1  is compiled.
